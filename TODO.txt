1. Load scene from file
2. Add ImGUI library and use it to load scenes
3. clean errors on shutdown
4. load unmodified shaders from previously compiled binary
5. add textures
6. implement effect, eg: fluid sim, radiance cascade, etc
7. Implement Work Graph (Using Warp driver if needed)


> check data locality?

> remove duplication of PSO & Root signature between renderable object & renderable object groups
should only be stored once in the group

> do a pass on what needs to be size_t / int16_t / int32_t

----------------------------
- test draw instanced using actual instances instead of individual calls
